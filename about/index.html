	<h4>About me</h4>
	<p>My name is Kamila Wosinek. I’ve worked as a themer-freelancer for couple of years. I prepare themes for Wordpress and Drupal’s websites. I write in SASS(SCSS). The moment which I like the most in my job is when i get a new graphic and I can start to create something totaly new. Besides that I’m interesting in photo editing and graphic desing, and maybe in the future this will be my job. I love change a place where i live so for me drem work is remote.</p>
	<h4 class="big-marg-top">About my work</h4>
	</p>While making theme usually I slice it from PSD by using Photoshop. I write my project in SASS(SCSS) & use Compass. It makes my work faster, and the code much more cleaner. I’m preparing flexible and responsive website with looks good on mobile devices. Mostly I use for this Twitter Bootstrap (i have expierience with verision 2 and 3). For preparing demo of website I use Jekyll. Daily I use command line and vim to writing a code, and git as a version control. To see projects I worked with click <a href="{{page.relative}}/projects">here!</a></p>
